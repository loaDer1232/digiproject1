eotc database
Hi  
this project is desigend to allow teacher to keep track of students on a eotc camp.  

# imporvments
there are sevral improvemts i am going to make to this program 
1. let users shearch by more values
2. readd the abilty to ammened the data in the tables 
3. fix the code i was perviosly using to make a bad version of a database (was removed due to causeing the program to crash unexpectly)
4. reduce the complexity of the code to improve the big O to somting better than O(n^2)

```2. Observing User Behaviors  

What are you thinking as you view the start screen?  

   

  It looks like it has a lot of detail but also as if it will be simple and easy for me to understand after a few moments to figure things out 

   

If you were looking for help where would you expect to find it?  

  

Chris is here 

   

How easy or difficult was it to navigate?  

   

It took a few moments to figure out what everything did but after that it was very easy for me to use. I found this very useful because it made everything easy to use which meant that everything was easy to use. It seems to have a lot of features that could be very useful for me to know about and be able to use. 

   

What are your thoughts on the design and layout?  

   

I think its laid out in a way which makes it so that everything is very easy to understand and to know how to do certain things 

   

End-to-End User Experience  

How would you describe your overall experience with the application?  

  

It seemed very Intuative which meant that it was intuative which helped because it meant that it was intuative. This was very helpful for me because I like when applications are intuative because it makes them easier to use because of how intuative they are   

  

What did you like the most about using this application?  

  

It had a lot of useful features that may be useful for me to have because useful features are useful and that means that they might be useful for something I need to do in the future. 

  

What did you like least 

  

At first the application seemed a little bit hard to use as if it may be complicated and this made me nervous at first but it was okay because the app turned out to be extremely intuitive and easy for me to use. This was unhelpful because looking at the start screen I could’ve turned around so I think it may have been a bit overengineered but it was okay because it turned out to be extremely easy for me to use. This was very helpful because at the start I was a bit nervous that it may have been a bit too complicated for me to use but it turned out to be very intuitive. This was useful because apps that are easy to use and figure out are much more appealing to me which made this app very appealing to me 

   

What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?  

   

The app was surprisingly simple to use despite having so many simple features. This was extremely helpful because it has a lot features that I wouldn’t expect to have been simple and easy to use but they were in fact quite easy for me to figure out how to use. 

  

What, if anything, caused you frustration?  

  

The only thing that caused me a slight bit of frustration would have to be the fact that at the beginning it looked like it may have been slightly complicated this almost turned me away because I thought it may have been really hard to use but it turned out to be really easy and simple for me to use as well as having a lot of very useful things for me to use as these helped me to be able to do whatever I needed to. The sherch function was a very helpful and useful thing for me to have as it allowed me to find certain things even if I wasn’t sure they were in the app at the moment as I could instead know that they were there. This helped me because it was useful to avoid confusion which meant that it was less confusing

The app was extremely simple and easy for me to use as well as having a lot of features that I wouldn’t have expected from an app that was so simple and easy to use. Although some of the spelling was a bit off such as how he labelled the search function sherch which kind of threw me off for a bit because I wasn’t sure what he meant. Overall an amazing app with few improvements that could be made.

# screencaps
this is the start up screen it is basicly just a four way menu     
![home](readmedata/home.PNG)   
this window lets you add new students     
![newstudent](readmedata/newstudent.PNG)   
this is the daly report logger i think this was the main part of the breif     
![dailyreport](readmedata/daily.PNG)    
and finaly the sherch window and the results table

# bugs
## solved bugs
one of the majoir bugs that the program currently has is when a user shurches by day the program returns several copies of each window 
![imag](readmedata/suerachbydaybug.PNG)
this is because of the the code surches though the data it does this by itarating tough the values of the array for each key so it returns mulatple times   
                          
                          Check = sherchbox.get()  
                          for i in data:      
                             for e in i.values():  
                                 if Check in e: 
                                   info = i  
                         
                         sherchoutput(info)```  
as you can see in the code sample above this wont be to hard to fix        
        
fix the dropdown menu in sherach
